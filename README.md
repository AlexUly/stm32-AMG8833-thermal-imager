Homemade thermal imager using STM32F103 and AMG8833. ILI9341 LCD is to display final image. Uses fixed color palette and short temperature range. 
Due to small matrix and weak range of the sensor final picture is not something to gawk at, but precision is somewhat high and can be used as convinient thermometer.
